After careful observation of stack, I realized that the pw, name, evil, good are placed on consecutively and it is possible to overwrite one or more of these four fields with a really large input to name or pw.
The aim was to print welcome message even if name and pw are different. So, I wrote ip2.c which creates an input file(my_file) for the given program(badbuf). my_file contains one string (size<123) that acts as 'login:' and another string (size=128*2)as 'pw:'. When run, the pw string overflows into name and thus name and pw end up being the same. The placement of '\0' is crucial for the attack to be successful.

Files:
1.badbuf.c 2.ip2.c 3.my_file 4.log 5.makefile 6.README
plus executables for badbuf.c and ip2.c

makefile uses a target named attack.
So , typing "make attack" runs the makefile, compiles both.c files, executes .o files with my_file acting as input.
